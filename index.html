                <h1>Mark Zuckerberg: A Comprehensive Biography</h1>
                <p><span>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</span> was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, to Karen
                    (née Kempner), a
                    psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist. He grew up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, alongside his
                    three sisters, Randi, Donna, and Arielle. From an early age, Zuckerberg showed a strong interest in
                    computers and programming. By the time he was 12, he had created a messaging program called
                    <span>"ZuckNet"</span> that his father used in his dental office.
                </p>
                <p>Zuckerberg attended Ardsley High School and later transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, an
                    exclusive preparatory school in New Hampshire. His programming skills continued to develop during
                    his high school years, and he created several software programs, including a music player called
                    <span>Synapse Media Player</span>, which used artificial intelligence to learn the user’s listening
                    habits.
                </p>
                <p>In 2002, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied psychology and computer science.
                    At Harvard, he quickly gained a reputation as a programming prodigy. It was during his time at
                    Harvard that he began work on what would eventually become <span>Facebook.</span></p>

                    <p>Facebook went public in 2012 — a major achievement for Mark Zuckerberg, who launched the tech start-up from his dormitory room at Harvard University. Zuckerberg and three of his friends first engineered an earlier version of the mega platform, called Thefacebook(dot)com, for sharing photos and contact details. By the end of 2004, Facebook had gained a million users, attracting the attention of tech’s most influential companies, but Zuckerberg declined offers to sell. At Facebook’s 2012 IPO, Zuckerberg kept a majority share and 50% of the voting rights. His net worth is now estimated at $111.2 (£83.7) billion.

                    <p>In 2021, Zuckerberg changed Facebook’s name to Meta, a signal for the long-anticipated metaverse. Within the metaverse, users can experience the integration of physical aspects within the digital sphere by using virtual reality. Zuckerberg predicts the metaverse will be the internet’s successor — the new way that people will interact using digital avatars. Meta’s chief focus will be to establish the metaverse and the methods necessary to access the space. At the company’s annual Connect conference, Zuckerberg says, ‘From now on, we’re going to be the metaverse first, not Facebook first.’                    </p>

                    <p>Zuckerberg created internet(dot)org in August 2013, alongside a 10-page paper explaining how connectivity should be a human right, and the ultimate aim was to connect some of the remotest areas to the internet. Internet(dot)org (renamed FreeBasics in 2015) partners with six other companies — Samsung, MediaTek, Nokia, Ericsson, Opera Software and Qualcomm. He wanted to make the internet more affordable, and created an education partnership with Nokia, AirTel and edX called SocialEDU, which provides students in Rwanda with free access to numerous educational experiences.</p>

                    <p>Zuckerberg shares his considerable wealth. In 2015, he and his wife Priscilla started the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, pledging to give 99% of their shares in Facebook to promoting equality and advancing the potential of people all over the world. The initiative announced an investment of $3 (£2.2) billion for curing the world’s diseases. CZI has donated millions to help students pay for college and has partnered with The College Board to help students preparing for college gateway exams. Zuckerberg has also supported many inner-city initiatives. In 2010, he gave $100 (£75.4) million to the Newark public school system to hire consultants as the district expanded charter school access.</p>
